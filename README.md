Welcome to **GadgetHeaven**, your top place to find the latest and coolest gadgets! GadgetHeaven is an easy-to-use e-commerce website designed to give you a smooth shopping experience with clear navigation, a handy cart and wishlist system, and a variety of gadgets to explore. This site is built with React, using the Context API and LocalStorage to manage and save data.


## ðŸ›  Key React Concepts Used
Here are the main React features used to build GadgetHeaven:
- **Components**: Reusable parts of the site like the Navbar, Footer, and Product Cards.
- **React Router**: Helps to link different pages like Home, Dashboard, Product Details, and the 404 page.
- **State Management**: Used to manage the app's data, like tracking items in the cart or wishlist.
- **useEffect Hook**: For loading data and updating when needed.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Changes the view based on actions, such as disabling the wishlist button after an item is added.

## ðŸ“¦ Data Handling
- **Context API**: Manages global data for things like the cart and wishlist, so these features work smoothly across the site.
- **LocalStorage**: Saves your cart and wishlist items, so you donâ€™t lose them if you refresh or revisit the site.

## ðŸŒŸ Main Features
1. **Shopping Cart**: Add items to your cart, see the total price, and sort items by cost.
2. **Wishlist**: Save items you like to a wishlist with one click. Items donâ€™t duplicate in the wishlist.
3. **Category Filtering**: Browse by gadget type (like computers, phones) using a sidebar for easy filtering.
4. **Smooth Navigation**: Responsive layout, automatic handling of page reloads, and an error-free experience.
